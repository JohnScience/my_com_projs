# My commercial programming story

My programming journey started rather early, at the age of 10 (2009). And only two years later (yes, at the age of 12) I started applying my nascent programming skills and knowledge commercially. I lived with grandparents who had a pension that was comparatively high but [low in absolute numbers](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1093950/average-monthly-retirement-benefit-value-russia/), so I had to work part-time to enjoy [tarkhun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarkhuna_(drink)), [baikal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baikal_(drink)), and pizza or simply even be able to buy water so that I could play soccer with my friends without suffering from thirst.

Legally, [working even part-time in Russia is possible only at the age of 14](https://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_34683/9627c87f117f9ccaaf55a73c9a614626c1e87ce0/), so I had to work on [Onionland](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Onionland) forums via [Tor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(network)) to circumvent the legal barrier that I consider unfair up to this day. My tools at the time were [Cheat Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheat_Engine) with [Lua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)) scripts for [dynamic analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_program_analysis), custom-patched [IDA Pro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Disassembler) for [static analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis), and a [FLY-CODE Dr Web Unpacker](https://cdn-download.drweb.com/pub/drweb/esuite/13.0.0/documentation/drweb-13.0-esuite-user-manual-windows-en.pdf) for cracking then-state-of-the-art [Armadillo Software Protection System](https://www.google.com/search?q=Armadillo+Software+Protection+System). *I deliberately never wrote, distributed, or in any way participated in the development of any malware.*

In 2013, I crated an account on no-longer-operational [фриланс.рф](фриланс.рф) where I started creating simple static [landing pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_page) with HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript (after approximately a half of a year of learning). Even at that point I did not have a GitHub or moreover GitLab account.

In 2015, I received a request from my friend employed by [Advance Roleplay](https://www.adv-rp.com/about_us/) project to write a script that would help him and his colleagues perform their administrator duties easier and more effectively. He knew that admins on other projects used scripts written in C++-like [AutoHotkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoHotkey) programming language. Fast-forward 2 years and in 2017 I become the top-2 on-demand AutoHotkey scripter among the small AutoHotkey programming community in Russia.

This solution consisted of several components:
  - Admin ID Generator. The one-time executable that obtained the serial number of the hard drive, and requested the server to finalize giving the admin rights to the account on the active SAMP launcher. In the process, it also assigned the admin a unique ID, hence the name. It also had a simplistic GUI that displayed such information as IP, encrypted serial number of the hard-drive, and the nickname of the active SAMP account. Upon competion, the application displayed a congratulatory window and overwrote the clipboard with the new admin ID, which the new administrator was supposed to keep secret. Since the access to the Admin ID Generator was supposed to be provided via one-time link and only over a screen-sharing session on Skype and the application was fairly useless for anyone without the pre-authorization, the Admin ID Generator never received its own builder.
  - Minimal PHP & MySQL server implementing the necessary routing and handlers, including those for keeping the track of the admin data records, as well as those for providing REST API for verification of one-time passwords-hashes generated based on the serial numbers of the hard drives and time (for up to 3 secs difference).
  - Secure Admin Log-in application builder. This builder was supposed to build binary-wise distinct yet functionally equivalent applications for each new admin so that the leaks of the applications were identifiable. Functionally, any of these applications would notify the server about being ran on a particular hardware (serial number of the hard drive) and on a particular IP so that the server could instantly remove the admin rights of the suspected admin if their admin ID is compomised and so that the admin could log-in with dynamically-generated passwords hassle-free.

Regardless of the family, these clients underwent the initialilizing procedure via a centralized PHP&MySQL server and after that established decentralized communication via UDP sockets using a simple custom binary protocol. The server was responsible for delivering the most important messages such as muting, unmuting, nickname change, etc, as well as for storing the financial information (expiry dates, client contacts, etc).

> *Note: the criticism was related to the need to know which one of the four string encodings was used by their client of SAMP (e.g. [ANSI](https://vovsoft.com/blog/difference-between-ansi-and-utf-8/)). Since there were multiple popular SAMP clients and the string encodings used by the client of SAMP could differ from those used by the OS, I did not see an easy way to determine the string encodings. In addition, the hosting provider [Fozzy](https://fozzy.com/us/) had short daily downtimes, which happened during the prime time due to the time difference.*

At this point,  I started readying for the ЕГЭ (Unified State Exams, similar to [gaokao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaokao) or [A-Levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-Level)) and putting extra time into competitive programming preparations. After that, by the summer of 2017, I graduated from 
[Perm School of Profound Study of Physics, Mathematics and Informatics No. 146](https://s146.ru/about) and moved to Calgary, Canada for the time of evaluation of my education documents. However, the school I attended was a [GAT (gifted-and-talented) eduction institution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gifted_education) and it came not only with perks but also with challenges, such as those pertaining to the evaluation of the diploma. For example, we had Linear Algebra in our curriculum, which is a university-level subject in many countries, including Russia and Canada. These legal details delayed the evaluation of my documents and, consequently, my enrollment into a university. So I was left with a choice either to have a [sabbatical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_year) or to study in a secondary school again while my documents were evaluated. I chose to attend a high school, improve my English, and get immersed into the new environment in Canada.

Even though I did relatively well in a new school, e.g. I had 95+ for Computer Science, I did not experience as much growth as I expected or desired. For instance, I did not do that great in English Language Arts (~60) and I could not get comprehensible feedback about my essays. I hardly could get anything more precise than "Your essays lacked flow". As a result, I had no single thing to meaningfully focus on at the new high school, so I switched my focus to search for a part-time or contract jobs in Software Development while I waited for the evaluation of my documents.

In the summer of 2018, I got remotely hired by SHANGHAI MOONTON TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD. Here is an excerpt from [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmitrii-demenev-9713a5167/) that summarizes my experience there:

> When I only started working there, I was placed in the Forum Development Dpt. My main responsibilities were to locate possible problems in the working website and suggest solutions for elimination of these problems. Since the success of Mobile Legends was unpredictably great, the small company (at that time, only around 20 employees) had to review their approaches and the code base on the run because the fan base rapidly grew in numbers. Having an expertise in V8 allowed me to locate problems and provide elaborate reports about the issues.
>
> When I deserved the company's trust and respect, I was placed in the Discord Dpt. where I was given access to ML API under the non-disclosure agreement in order to develop a multipurpose bot which processed natural language, gathered relevant information and prepared a ground for better monetization. In January of 2019 I had to give up my position and postpone studying altogether because I had issues with my cognitive health after a head injury.

For almost 1.5 of a year after the incident I was unable to walk on my own and to talk without heavy stuttering. However, I persevered despite the difficulty.

Even though initially I was barely able even to help myself, four months after the incident (April of 2019) I started slowly but surely working on the programming project that would eventually turn first into a product, and then into a short-lived but still a company. However, it did not happen immediately.

After two months of work, in the July of 2019, I got contacted by my friend Сергей Гонин ( [VK](https://vk.com/sergeygonin) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygonin/) ) who was running low on time to meet the deadline. He requested my assistance, which I agreed to provide while warning about the situation.

they all to some extent experienced a lack of time. This was especially true for more popular streamers, while smaller streamers did not get any sponsored content or ads. Streamers of all audience sizes also disliked if not hated the discussion of terms of native ads on live streams and in videos. They wanted to focus on creating content instead of doing the negotiations. That's why I decided to create a platform that would help streamers monetize their influence without hassle while offering companies an easy and cheap way to create marketing campaigns targeting the aduiences of the partnered streamers.

After four months of work, the basic functionality of the platform was implemented, the next step was to start getting the content creators onboard. Even though the setup was designed to be very easy, convincing the streamers to add a third-party component to their [OBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBS_Studio) was a task requiring great care and thorough preparations. 

That's when I decided to cooperate with my previous employer, Moonton, to create some value for the streamers that would help get them on board. As a previous employee at a Discord department, I had experience of working with ML API, which notably exposed rank (also colloquially known as MMR or "stars").

After negotiations with my previous superior, my use of the API for small-scale testing was approved and in a couple of days the rank-displaying OBS component was ready and synchronized with the ML API via the relay that hid the actual ML API endpoints for the users.

And soon the access to the component would be provided to the first big streamer, [Jimahn "Gosu General" Park](https://www.youtube.com/@Teamgosu), who at the time had 10,000+ concurrent viewers on his streams in prime time.

With around 20,000 concurrent viewers, we got our first marketing campaigns and first expansion of the team.

Unfortunately, the API was not prepared for such a broad use and got whitelisted. And getting access to the code even for the purpose of improvement and even with demonstrable financial gains was non-negotiable for non-residents of Shanghai. The operation was quickly halted as soon as the last contract would end, leaving the company in a sizable net-profit.

In October of 2019, I was offered a part-time position in R&D (Rust) for a small startup DBChase founded by an MIT graduate, [Adil Mac](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adil-m-304bb23/). Details of the work there are protected by a [NDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement). I left the company in April 2020.

In November of 2020, I started studying remotely at Athabasca University (at the time, the only university in Canada accredited for delivering fully remote university programs) because attending a university in person was still challenging and I needed a reduced load.

In November of 2022, I accepted a contract for [Repalab](https://repalab.ru/), a Russian-based startup building the software for analysis of images of lungs in [DICOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DICOM) and [NIFTI-1](https://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1/) formats.

Before I even contracted the startup, they already had core functionality written in Go programming language. They had an ML-powered server that generated "masks" (matrices of 1s and 0s) where 0 meant that the area of lung suffered from [ground-glass opacity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground-glass_opacity). And, according to the plan, the next stage of the project was to create a web application that would allow the radiologists to correct the masks as necessary, thereby semi-automating this worfklow (so that eventually this step could be fully automated). However, as the result of the research they conducted, they discovered several challenges:
  
  1. Work with the host filesystem was complicated by safety measures in browsers.
  2. These file formats ([DICOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DICOM) and [NIFTI-1](https://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1/)) were too niche and weren't supported by *any* JavaScript library.
  3. The prototype experienced performance issues because the files were multi-dimensional, often [bit-deep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_depth) to reflect [Houndsfield scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hounsfield_scale), and not always Euclidean (i.e. the collective "shape" of the voxels was not a [orthotope](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Orthotope.html)).

At this point they started looking for candidates with [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) experience.
  
Even though I didn't know the intricate details of WebAssembly bytecode, I programmed in Rust, which at the time of writing the document had the highest support for WebAssembly among all programming languages at the time due to [`wasm_pack`](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-pack/), [`wasm_bindgen`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen), [`web_sys`](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/api/web_sys/index.html), [`js_sys`](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/contributing/js-sys/index.html), [`wapm`](https://github.com/wapm-packages/rust-wasi-example) and others. As a result, I was accepted for a paid probationary period.
  
Within the first two-week [sprint](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/definition/Scrum-sprint) I managed  to implement the most basic [paint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Paint)-like interface.

I discovered that [jmtyszka/atlaskit/nifti2png.py](https://github.com/jmtyszka/atlaskit/blob/master/nifti2png.py) was flawed in numerous and sometimes unexpected ways when converting it into Rust using [pyo3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3#using-python-from-rust).
  
Once the most basic functionality was ready, we collectively decided to ship our static frontend as an [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) app in order to avoid challenges with safety in browsers. However, later in the development we decided to switch to [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) because I discovered that [`electron-forge`](https://www.electronforge.io/) did not support local dependencies on Windows. In addition, switching to Tauri allowed using Rust for the development of the [core process](https://tauri.app/v1/references/architecture/process-model#the-core-process), which is analogous to the [main process in Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/process-model#the-main-process), without [`neon`](https://neon-bindings.com/) bindings.

During the testing, the app started crashing during the initialization. After debugging, I identified that the problem was the [issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/42869) with [`std::fs::canonicalize`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fs/fn.canonicalize.html), which on Windows could return a [UNC-path](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/unc).

When we changed the default image from 512x512x101 to a higher quality image, the image underneath the canvas in the [WebView process](https://tauri.app/v1/references/architecture/process-model#the-webview-process) started experiencing slow initialization time. Initially, I had a presupposition that the cause of the slow initialization was the slowness of the reimplmenetation of the script from AtlasKit because it was dealing with the non-volatile drives (SSD/HDD), which are known to be hundreds of thousands times slower than in-memory processing. However, after benchmarking I discovered that the real cause of the slowness was the [IPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication). From [this issue](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/discussions/5511) I learned an alternative, which drastically alleviated the slowness, bringing it down to the tolerable levels.

For the data transfer, I decided to implement a custom protocol in order to fully utilize [`ReadableStreamBYOBReader`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStreamBYOBReader) and [`ReadableStreamDefaultReader`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStreamDefaultReader) interfaces and provide smooth user experience.
